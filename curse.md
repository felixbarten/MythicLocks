## How to use

The addon can be used by issuing one of the following commands ingame: `/locks /mlocks /mythiclocks`

## Options

The addon supports two options: "saved" if the addon is invoked `/locks saved` it will also show the user which Mythic dungeons they are locked to. 

There is also an option to view legion mythics by calling `/locks legion` These two options can also be combined. 

## Caveats

This addon currently only works on English versions of the game due to checking the names of the dungeons.
